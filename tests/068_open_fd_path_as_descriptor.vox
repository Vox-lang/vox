(Open-at numeric path should be treated as a file descriptor)
(This test verifies that a numeric path like 1 is handled as the already-open)
(file descriptor for stdout, not as a filesystem path, and contrasts it with)
(opening "/dev/stdout" via a string path.)

Open a file for writing called out at 1.
On error print "failed to use fd 1".
Write "fd-open-ok" to out.

Open a file for appending called devout at "/dev/stdout".
On error print "failed to open /dev/stdout".
Write "/dev/stdout-open-ok" to devout.
