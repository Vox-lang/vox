# Compiler bugs found while building a JSON library for Vox

Found while designing, writing, and testing `json.vox` against the v0.3.5 binary
(commit-matched to the `Vox-lang/vox` source tree). Every repro below is minimal,
standalone, and was re-run in isolation to confirm it's not an artifact of the
surrounding code. Each is real Vox behavior, not a misreading of the docs on my
part — where I *thought* I'd found a bug and it turned out to be my own mistake
(mostly comma/period sentence-grouping errors), those are noted at the bottom
instead, since they're worth knowing about even though they aren't compiler bugs.

---

### 1. A float routed through `{}` interpolation into `text`/`buffer` prints the raw bit pattern

```vox
a float called y is 3.5.
Print "{y}".              (correct: 3.5)

a text called t is "{y}".
Print t.                   (wrong: 4615063718147915776)

a buffer called b is "{y}".
Print b.                   (also wrong: same bit pattern)
```

Direct `Print y.` and the cast `y as text` both give the correct `3.5`. Only
interpolation into a `text`/`buffer` destination is affected. Doesn't affect
`number` or `boolean` interpolated the same way. This is distinct from the bug
the 0.3.5 changelog says it fixed (`Print` on an inlined float-returning call) —
that one's genuinely fixed; this is a different code path with the same symptom.

**Workaround:** use `as text` on a statically-typed `float` instead of `{}`.

---

### 2. `value` → `float`: reassignment is broken, declare-with-initializer isn't

```vox
To identity with a value called v. Return a value, v.
a value called vf is identity of 3.5.

a float called y is 0.0.
the y is vf.
Print y.                          (wrong: 4615063718147915776)

a float called y2 is vf.
Print y2.                         (correct: 3.5)
```

LANGUAGE.md states `x is <v>.`, `the x is <v>.`, and `Set x to <v>.` are "checked
the same way." They aren't, at least for extracting a float out of a `value` —
only the declare-with-initializer form works.

**Workaround:** always extract via a fresh declaration, never reassign an
existing float from a `value`. I used this as a two-line helper throughout the
library (declare a fresh `float` from the `value`, then `as text` cast that).

---

### 3. `but if` is restricted to `print` actions — silently, undocumented

```vox
a list called source is [1, 2, 3].
a list called dest is [].
append each n from source to dest,
    but if n modulo 2 is equal to 0 append 0 to dest.
```
```
error: 'but if' conditional branching only works with print statements
```

LANGUAGE.md frames loop expansion as working "with any action" and never states
this restriction in either of the two `but if` sections. The error message
itself is clear once you hit it — it's just not documented anywhere you'd see
it in advance.

---

### 4. A top-level `number` global doesn't retain mutations made inside a function

```vox
a number called g is 0.
To bump. Set g to g add 1.

bump.
bump.
bump.
print g.                          (prints 0, not 3)
```

**Workaround, confirmed correct:** box the value in a `list`. `element 1 of`
and `set element 1 of` on a list-of-one *does* persist correctly across calls,
since lists (like buffers) are reference-mutated properly — only the plain
scalar global is affected. I used this pattern for the parser's cursor position.

---

### 5. Omitting the blank line after a function definition is silently required, not "not a requirement"

LANGUAGE.md's exact words: *"Function definitions are typically followed by a
blank line to visually separate them from other code, **but this is a style
convention, not a requirement**."*

```vox
To ping.
  Print "pong".
Print "after".
```

Produces **zero output** — not even "pong". Both statements get silently
absorbed into `ping`'s body, and since `ping` is never called, neither runs.
Exit code 0, no error, no warning. Restore the blank line and `after` prints
correctly (still without `pong`, since `ping` still isn't called — which
confirms the absorption, not some unrelated issue).

---

### 6. A variable named `length` reading `.size`/`.length` fails, blaming `"size"`

```vox
a buffer called data is "hello".
a number called length is data's length.
```
```
error: Cannot use 'size' as a variable name - it's a reserved keyword
```

`length` isn't actually reserved — it's used as an ordinary variable name
throughout LANGUAGE.md's own examples. Renaming *only the target variable*
(keeping the same `.length` read) compiles fine. The `length`/`size` alias
canonicalization is leaking into the declared name's own reserved-word check.

---

### 7. `map's "{loopvar}"` fails when the loop variable comes from `.keys`

```vox
a map called m is {"a": 1, "b": "two"}.
a list called ks is m's keys.
For each k in ks,
  a value called v is m's "{k}",
  print "key={k} value={v}".
```

Prints `key=a value=0` / `key=b value=0` — always the not-found sentinel (`0`),
even though `k` prints correctly as text and the key genuinely exists. The
*identical* code with `ks` as a hand-written list literal (`["a", "b"]`) instead
of `m's keys` works correctly. `.keys` itself enumerates correctly (confirmed
separately) — it's specifically using one of its elements as an interpolated
key that fails.

**Workaround:** never dynamic-key-lookup using a `.keys`-derived loop variable.
Get `.keys` and `.values` as two parallel lists and walk them by index instead
— that's what the library's map serializer does, and it sidesteps this entirely.

---

### 8. Extracting a `list` from a `value` corrupts it; `float` and `map` extraction (the same way) don't

```vox
To inspect with a value called item.
  print "direct: {item}".               (correct: [10, 20, 30])
  a list called xs is item.
  print "extracted: {xs}".               (wrong: a raw pointer-looking number)
  print "extracted length: {xs's length}".  (wrong: -1)

inspect with [10, 20, 30].
```

Declare-with-initializer extraction (bug #2's workaround pattern) works for
`float` and, separately confirmed, for `map` — but not for `list`, where even
a bare `print` of the extracted variable is wrong.

**Workaround:** never extract a `list` from a `value`. `For each x in item,`
iterates directly over a value known (via `is a list`) to hold a list, with
no extraction step, and this works correctly. The library's generic serializer
uses this for its list-value path.

---

### 9. `buffer as text` cast silently returns an empty string

```vox
a buffer called b is "hello".
a text called t1 is b as text.
print "[{t1}]".              (wrong: [])

a text called t2 is "{b}".
print "[{t2}]".              (correct: [hello])
```

**Workaround:** use `"{buffer_var}"` interpolation, never `as text`, to read a
buffer's contents into a text value.

---

### 10. A bare `{` or `}` in a string literal throws a confusing, empty-named error

```vox
append "{" to destination.
```
```
error: Unknown variable: 
```

The variable name in the error is empty. LANGUAGE.md documents `{{`/`}}` as
the escape for a literal brace, but the error gives no hint that's what's
needed — it reads like an internal parser failure, not a usage mistake.

---

### 11. That error's reported line can be badly misattributed

Building the library, a genuine unmatched-brace bug in my map serializer (see
#10) was reported by the compiler as `Unknown variable: ` at a **completely
different, unrelated line** — one that contained a valid, complete `{b:02x}`
format expression. I confirmed this isn't a coincidence: fixing the real bug
(the actual bare brace, many lines away) made the phantom error at the
unrelated line disappear entirely. I'd guess this is the same class of issue
as the project's own `073_type_lock_caret_points_at_write_site`-style tests,
just a different trigger.

---

### 12. A nested if/but-if chain with no trailing `Otherwise`, as the last action in an outer branch, silently breaks everything after it

This is the deepest and most consequential bug I found — I hit it in two
different shapes, and it's worth stating as a general pattern rather than two
unrelated reports.

**Shape A — silent infinite loop.** A `While` loop's body ends in `if b is
equal to 92 then, [...9-way But-if chain with no Otherwise...]. Otherwise,
[plain-character branch].` The outer `if/Otherwise` is a complete, self-closed
construct — but because the *inner* chain has no `Otherwise` of its own, the
loop's own increment/exit logic that should follow gets silently misattached.
The visible symptom was a hang with no error; giving the inner chain an
explicit `Otherwise` (even a no-op one) fixed it outright:

```vox
While true,
  ...
  if b is equal to 92 then,
    ...
    If escaped is equal to 34 then, ...
    But if escaped is equal to 117 then, ...
    Otherwise,                          (<- adding this fixed the hang)
      'json parse advance' with cursor.
  Otherwise,
    ...
  increment guard.                      (<- never ran without the fix above)
```

**Shape B — a construct whose last action is itself unclosed.** Separately, in
the number parser:

```vox
If exp_count is greater than 0 then,
  ...
  While ii is less than exponent_value,
    ...
    increment ii.
If exp_count is greater than 0 then, Return a value, base_value.   (swallowed
                                                                      into the
                                                                      first If)
```

The first `If`'s last action is a `While` loop; the `While` closes correctly
via its own last plain statement, but that does *not* close the outer `If` —
so the second, unrelated `If` (and everything after it) gets absorbed into the
first one's body, corrupting a completely different variable
(`Unknown variable: final_int`, reported several lines past where the real
problem was).

**The pattern:** if a branch's last action is itself a construct (an if-chain
or a loop) that doesn't end in a plain, non-clause-opening statement, whatever
follows at the outer level risks silent misattachment — sometimes causing a
hang, sometimes a garbled unrelated error. The fix in both cases was the same:
restructure so nothing meaningful follows a "bare" nested construct — either
give the inner chain its own `Otherwise`, or move the trailing logic into a
plain statement, or split into a second function.

---

### 13. Chaining `element N of X's property` in one expression corrupts the result — splitting it into two statements doesn't

```vox
a map called m is {"status": "ok", "count": 3}.

a value called chained is element 1 of m's values.
print "chained: {chained}".              (wrong: 4214989)

a list called vs is m's values.
a value called separate is element 1 of vs.
print "separate: {separate}".            (correct: ok)
```

Same map, same program, same read — the only difference is whether the
`.values` read has its own statement or is inlined into the `element N of`
expression. I initially chased this as a "map extracted from a value" bug (an
early version of the JSON library's demo genuinely produced a garbage pointer
this way) before isolating that the extraction was irrelevant — the chaining
itself is the trigger, on a perfectly ordinary, directly-declared map.

**Workaround:** never chain `element N of X's property` — always read the
property into its own variable first. I checked the library's own source for
this pattern afterward; it doesn't appear anywhere, which is presumably why
the round-trip tests all passed cleanly.

---

## Not bugs — my own mistakes, worth knowing about anyway

- **Comma vs. period inside a loop/if is unforgiving.** A period closes only
  the *innermost currently-open* clause. If that's a nested `if`, the outer
  loop stays open and silently absorbs whatever comes next as a repeating
  per-iteration action — including statements clearly meant to run once, after
  the loop. I re-derived this the hard way at least four separate times before
  it stuck.
- **`"1.5e10" as a float` silently truncates to `1.5`.** Not a bug against the
  docs — Vox's own float literal grammar has no exponent form either, so the
  cast is consistent with the language, just short of JSON's number grammar.
  The library applies exponents manually (repeated multiply/divide by 10)
  rather than relying on the cast.
- **Duplicate function definitions in one file compile silently when standalone**,
  and only surface as a NASM `label inconsistently redefined` linker error once
  another file `see`s it. This was my own leftover code from an earlier edit,
  not a language bug — but a friendlier duplicate-definition diagnostic at the
  Vox level would have caught it immediately instead of several edits later.
